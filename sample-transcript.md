[00:06] Hello?
[00:07] Hello.
[00:08] Oh, hello.
[00:08] I didn't know you were there.
[00:09] Neither did I. OK, I thought, you know, I heard a beep.
[00:12] This is Diane in New Jersey.
[00:14] And I'm Sheila in Texas, originally from Chicago.
[00:17] Oh, I'm originally from Chicago also.
[00:20] I'm in New Jersey now, though.
[00:21] Well, there isn't that much difference.
[00:24] At least, you know, they all call me a Yankee down here, so what can I say?
[00:28] Oh, I don't hear that in New Jersey now.
